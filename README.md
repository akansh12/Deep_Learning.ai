1. Making a Neural Network from Scratch using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Learning concepts of the Activation function, their importance, and different type, Logistic regression, ReLu, Leaky Relu.

2. Learned about different Hyper Parameters in Neural Networks. Learned about vanishing Gradient descent, Regularisation Techniques, batch-norm, etc. Introduction to TensorFlow.

3. Learned about CNN, implemented it using Keras and TensorFlow. Learned about Resnet and many things. Performed Neural Style transfer and many other algo like YOLO.
